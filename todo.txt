This file is for the "big" TODOs that can't be described in a comment.

- [ ] Fix the execution of "mwccarm -S file.c"
    - It would be nice to patch over the function that calls CreateProcessA()
      in order to avoid the back-and-forth conversion of argv.
- [ ] Figure out what to do about findexe()
    - This function is called in two scenarios: When finding its own executable
      path, and when it's finding other executables to run. The heurestics for
      this search aren't entirely suitable to our port, and it's one small step
      towards reimplementing important parts of the tool.
    - It would also allow us to use the program without a ".exe" suffix.
- [ ] Make the following work: "echo 'int a(){}' > test.c;./build/relink/mwccarm-4.0-1051.exe -enc SJIS -c test.c"
    - This allows parsing SHIFT-JIS encoded text, for example where yen
      characters are involved. Support ought to be verified.
